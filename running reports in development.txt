Hi Tal,

I worked out that it is easier to install rabbitMQ on Windows than WSL. To do this:

install Chocolately if you don't have it already: https://community.chocolatey.org/

now open a Windows Administrator prompt: https://www.howtogeek.com/194041/how-to-open-the-command-prompt-as-administrator-in-windows-10/

in the command window, type:

choco install rabbitmq

Once rabbitmq is installed, you should be able to start celery. 

Full startup procedure
======================

- open a command prompt, type:

wsl

This will open a wsl session and redis should start automatically. Leave the window open.

- open another command, cd to your digby_backend directory, type:

celery -A app:celery worker --pool=solo -l info

This should start celery running. If everything is ok it should display something like these lines once it is running:

[2024-09-04 17:39:48,309: INFO/MainProcess] Connected to amqp://guest:**@127.0.0.1:5672//
[2024-09-04 17:39:48,317: INFO/MainProcess] mingle: searching for neighbors
[2024-09-04 17:39:49,352: INFO/MainProcess] mingle: all alone
[2024-09-04 17:39:49,377: INFO/MainProcess] celery@Raven ready.

Keep the Celery window open.

- now go to VS Code. In the file api/reports.py, comment out this code around lines 180-182:

            #from api.reports.rep_genotype_heatmap import run
            #run(args.format, args.species, genomic_datasets, genomic_samples, rep_datasets, rep_samples, params)
            #raise BadRequest("we're debugging!")
			
- start the server from the > prompt, like we did yesterday. 

Now go to the browser and enter the URL you are using to run your report. If everything is ok, you should see
some action in the Celery window, as it runs your report. 

... if any of these steps don't work as expected, ping me on Slack.


Timing your report
==================

The report is now running in the mode used on the server and you can time how long it takes. That will give you a fairer comparison against the time taken by the server to run the old report.

Debugging your report
=====================

You can't set breakpoints in your code in this mode, because it is running as a separate process. To debug it, uncomment the three lines you commented out earlier. In this line:

from api.reports.rep_genotype_heatmap import run

make sure that the imported module (api.reports.rep_genotype_heatmap) matches the filename of the report you want to run (api/reports/rep_genotype_heatmap.py)
